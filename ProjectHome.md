# Introduction #
This application allows you to control media playback of VideoLAN Client (VLC) from your Android-powered mobile device.

You must enable the HTTP interface in VLC for this application to work.

To start VLC HTTP server from the command line, use a command like this:

`vlc --extraintf=luahttp --fullscreen --http-album-art --qt-start-minimized`

For more help, please see [VLC HTTP interface documentation](https://wiki.videolan.org/Documentation:Modules/http_intf/).

For technical help, please see [Troubleshooting](http://code.google.com/p/android-vlc-remote/wiki/Troubleshooting).

Note: The album art and DVD navigation features are experimental and may not always work.
